These formulas are from the book "New Market Timing Techniques" and "Demark Indicators" by Demark.
The oscillators from the books are:
      TD Rate of Change
      TD Range Expansion Index
      TD Pressure
      TD Demarker 1
      TD Demarker 2

They combine to create the TD Alignment script which could be a non overlay line or overlay buy/sell signal at +5/-5. 
When an indicator is in the predifined overbought zone it is given a value of +1.
When an indicator is in the predefined oversold zone it is given a value of -1
Extreme TD alignment readings at +5 or -5 is associated with near term price exhaustion
  when combined with TD Sequential and TD Combo.

//////// TD Rate of Change - Start ///////
Divide the close of the current price bar by the close 12 price bars earlier.
  Overbought/oversold band fluctiates between 97.5% and 102.5%.
  If intraday trading (for example 1,5,10 minute timeframes) adjust the bands to 99.75% and 100.25%.
    For 15 or fewer price bars a potential top/bottom is discovered.
    Beyond 16 and trend is likely to extend at random lengths.
    
    The idea for the TD ROC indicator (non overlay)
        plot both bands
        plot an X on 16th bar and further (or highlight), if price remains to be overbought/oversold.
    The idea for TD Alignment script
        12 and fewer overbought/oversold bars are given a +1/-1 value. 
        13th and on overbought/oversold bars are given zero a 0 value.
        
The overall point of this is: 
      extreme signals (being overbought/oversold 16+ bars) there may be extention of the current trend
      mild signals (being overbought/oversold under 16 bars, ideally 12 or fewer) tend to show trend reversal.

//////// TD Range Expansion Index - Start ///////
This has a couple different parts.
  
  Add the following:
  The differnce between the high of the current bar and the high 2 bars earlier
  TO
  The difference between the low of the current bar and the low 2 bars earlier
  X = (H - H[2]) + (L - L[2])
  
  Condition 1:
    High of current price bar must be greater or equal to low either 5 or 6 bars earlier.
    OR
    High of two bars ago must be greater than or equal to close 7 or 8 bars ago.
  Condition 2:
    Low of current bar must be less than or equal to high either 5 or 6 bars earlier.
    OR
    High of two bars ago must be less than or equal to close either 7 or 8 bars ago.
  
  If EITHER condition NOT satisfied current bar is assigned a 0 value.
  
  If BOTH conditions met the value for that bar is calculated by the following:
    Add the differnece between high and low for each bar of a 5 bar period.
    Total all values.
    Divide the result by the highest highest high and lowest low.
    Multiply that result by 100.
          This creates a range of -100 to 100. 
          Overbought being +45 and oversold being -45.
  Y = sum of difference of high and low of bar1 through bar5
  H5 = highest high over last 5 bars
  L5 = lowest low over last 5 bars
  TD REI = (Y/(H5 - L5)) X 100
  
  The idea for the TD REI indicator (non overlay)
        plot both bands
        highlight the area when price is above/below those ranges.
        Plot Buy Signal if all conditions met:
          TD REI below -45 for 6 or fewer bars.
          Closing price greater than prior close.
          Open of next bar must be less than or equal to 2 prior price highs.
          Market must trade above the open and post a high above either one of the prior 2 price highs.
        Plot Sell Signal if all conditions met:
          TD REI abocve +45 for 6 or fewer bars.
          Closing price greater than prior close.
          Open of next bar must be greater than or equal to prior price lows.
          Market must trade below the open and post a low below either one of the prior 2 price lows.
        **If intraday trading (for example 1,5,10 minute timeframes) adjust the bands to +30/-30
          
  The idea for TD Alignment script
        6 and fewer overbought/oversold bars are given a +1/-1 value. 
        7th and on overbought/oversold bars are given zero a 0 value.

The overall point of this is:
      Similar to RSI, but more responsive to price fluctiations
      Compares overlaping ranges over time to identify reversals when market is volatile.
      mild signals (being overbought/oversold under 6 bars) tend to show trend reversal.
//////// TD Range Expansion - End ///////

//////// TD Pressure - Start ///////
    The idea for the TD Pressure indicator (non overlay)
        plot both bands at 75 and 25
        Plot signal when crossing below 75 and crossing over 25
    The idea for TD Alignment script
        5 bars overbought above 82 /oversold below 18 are given a +1/-1 value. 
        6th bar overbough/oversold and all else are given a 0 value.
        
        
 This one is hard for me to get because I get lost on the volume part.
 
 "... Demark devised a ration bty subtracting the current open from the current close, divided by the current range
 which assigns percentages to buying and selling pressure. That ration is multiplied by current volume numbers, and
 the result is totaled over time... Demark uses a 5-price-bar period and compares the current close and open, 
 divided by the current volume. The 5-bar ratio of that buying pressure is totaled and then divided by the
 absolute calue of ths 5 price bars."
 
 For trading futures:
  "(volume / open interest) * volume"
 
 I found a script that looks like the standard TD pressure but I have no idea what most of those functions are. 
 I haven't figured out the "for" stuff yet in pinescript.
